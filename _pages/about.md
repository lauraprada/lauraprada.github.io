<p><h7><b>Welcome!</b>  I am Laura Prada, a research economist passionate about leveraging behavioral insights to inform data-driven policymaking. Currently, I am a PhD student in Public Policy and Management at the USC Price School of Public Policy. My research focuses on behavioral interventions and their role in addressing poverty and inequality. </h7></p>

<p><h7>Previously, I worked as a researcher in the behavioral team at Colombia’s tax administration, designing interventions to improve tax compliance. I have also been a consultant at the Hertie School and the World Bank, as well as a research assistant at Universidad del Rosario and the Central Bank of Colombia. </h7></p>
