<p><h7><b>Welcome!</b>  I'm Laura Prada, a young research economist with a keen interest in using insights into people's behavior to drive data-informed decisions. Currently, I'm working as a consultant at the Hertie School and also at Colombia's taxes administration institution, where I focus on designing behavioral interventions to boost tax compliance.</h7></p>

<p><h7>Before this, I had the opportunity to work as a consultant at the World Bank and as a research assistant at both Universidad del Rosario and the Central Bank of Colombia.</h7></p>

<p><h7>My academic background includes an M.Sc. in Economics from Universidad del Rosario and a B.A. in Economics from Universidad Industrial de Santander. I'm particularly passionate about Experimental Economics, Development, Gender, and Behavioral Science, where I seek to make a meaningful impact. </h7></p>
