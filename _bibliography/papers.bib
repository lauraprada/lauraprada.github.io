    abstract = { The authors adapted a lab-in-the-field experiment emulating the dynamic extraction of a fishery to create a Web-based classroom experiment. The game includes a multi-player version analogous to an open-access problem and a single-player version analogous to the social planner problem. This game is helpful in introductory microeconomics courses to teach about dominant strategies and the consequences of resource rivalry. In elective courses, the game helps teach bio-economics concepts, including logistic growth functions and optimal extraction paths. Instructions for game deployment and creating the sessions are provided. Conducting the game takes about 20 minutes, and because the game is Web-based, students can access it from their laptops, tablets, or smartphones. }

    abstract = {We conduct a lab-in-the-field experiment in which 214 rural workers must choose betweena  cash  or  a  voucher  payment  for  completing  a  real-effort  task.   Participants  face  a  twenty-percent chance of suffering a negative shock that will reduce their cash payment by roughlytwo-thirds. Opting for the voucher reduces the likelihood of the shock by one-half. We employa multiple-price list with a varying voucher payment and a fixed cash payment to study thistrade-off relevant for expanding the coverage and contributions of rural labor formalization.We find that take-up rates go from 32% to 56%, from the least to the more generous voucher. Ina reference sample of undergrad students from the same region, take-up rates went from 17%to 33%.  Voucher redemption costs are exogenously manipulated by randomly assigning theshow-up fee in cash or vouchers.  Lower redemption costs induce a higher voucher take-up,but only among students. Being a rural worker with land, and receiving government subsidiesin cash, predict a higher voucher take-up.}

    abstract = {I document how the procedure of allocating barely identical tasks among team members affects productivity and the willingness to pay for repeating the job alone rather than in teams. I find a complementarity relation between the assignment procedure (by-choice, imposed by a third party with a higher hierarchy, or random) and the preferences about the task to perform. For participants in the Imposed mechanism, being assigned to a preferred task increases performance, while being imposed on a non-preferred task negatively affects performance. Moreover, I find that the participants who were more interested in paying for autonomy were those randomly assigned to be autonomous (by-choice) at the beginning of the experiment. Hence, these results suggest that people care about factors beyond payoffs, such as autonomy. Among self-employed workers, the effect on the productivity of being imposed on a non-preferred task is exacerbated, and I did not find any statistical impact on the willingness to pay for playing alone.}
