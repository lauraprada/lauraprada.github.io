    abstract = {The authors adapted a lab-in-the-field experiment emulating the dynamic extraction of a fishery to create a Web-based classroom experiment. The game includes a multi-player version analogous to an open-access problem and a single-player version analogous to the social planner problem. This game is helpful in introductory microeconomics courses to teach about dominant strategies and the consequences of resource rivalry. In elective courses, the game helps teach bio-economics concepts, including logistic growth functions and optimal extraction paths. Instructions for game deployment and creating the sessions are provided. Conducting the game takes about 20 minutes, and because the game is Web-based, students can access it from their laptops, tablets, or smartphones. }

    abstract = {We conduct a lab-in-the-field experiment in which 214 Colombian rural workers must choose between cash or a voucher payment for completing a real-effort task. Although the voucher may be perceived as non-fungible, it halves the probability of suffering a negative shock that will reduce the participant's payment by two-thirds. We hold constant the cash payment and explore four different voucher values that, in expectation, range from 88% to 123% of the cash payment. We find that take-up rates go from 32% to 56%, from the least to the more generous voucher. These rates are consistently larger compared to a reference sample of undergrad students from the same region. Our between-subjects variations reveal that presenting the vouchers in descending order yields a higher take-up than the ascending order, which we interpret as an endowment effect of the voucher's risk reduction.}

    abstract = {I document how the procedure of allocating barely identical tasks among team members affects productivity and the willingness to pay for repeating the job alone rather than in teams. I find a complementarity relation between the assignment procedure (by-choice, imposed by a third party with a higher hierarchy, or random) and the preferences about the task to perform. For participants in the Imposed mechanism, being assigned to a preferred task increases performance, while being imposed on a non-preferred task negatively affects performance. Moreover, I find that the participants who were more interested in paying for autonomy were those randomly assigned to be autonomous (by-choice) at the beginning of the experiment. Hence, these results suggest that people care about factors beyond payoffs, such as autonomy. Among self-employed workers, the effect on the productivity of being imposed on a non-preferred task is exacerbated, and I did not find any statistical impact on the willingness to pay for playing alone.}
